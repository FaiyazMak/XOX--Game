Everything is good for pc...
but that line after winning thing has to be sorted for media query.
For now i have done display none for .line when we hit media query...
i did this coz i was not able to fix position and length that could match after decreasing certain screen width.
Has to sort this issue
Also use that same excitement image after winning ...used in actual tut-project.
Improments that could be made:
1)make that line work at media queries as well...so that this line thing after winning works in mobile as well.
2)Use sockets and server to make it online game, to be played with friend who is in remote area.
3)Properly host it to be able to manage large traffic.
4)Can use more animations..
